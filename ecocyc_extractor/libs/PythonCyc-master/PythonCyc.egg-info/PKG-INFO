        PythonCyc 2.0, January 2020
        ===========================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        An updated version of the original PythonCyc API from Mario Latendresse.
        
        This module has been tested under Python 3.6 and Python 3.8, with examples
        at https://github.com/networkbiolab/PythonCyc/tree/master/examples
        
        Disclaimer: a number of functions remains broken.
        
        
        PythonCyc 1.0, November 2014
        ============================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        The PythonCyc module provides a Python interface to a Pathway Tools
        application running either locally or remotely. This module has been
        designed to work on the three platforms supported by Pathway Tools:
        Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Pathway Tools version 18.5 or
        above is needed to use this module.
        
        This module has been tested under Python 2.6 and 2.7, IPython 2.1 and
        IPython notebook.

        Thanks to Eli Bogart to have inspired some implementation details of
        PythonCyc via PyCyc, Tomer Altman for the Pathway Tools API
        documentation, and Daniel Weaver for suggesting to implement some
        specific functions and his design, with Kai Chen, of the beautiful PythonCyc logo.
